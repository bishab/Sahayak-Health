# AI HEALTH BOT
A sophisticated implementation of RASA Conversational AI on a HealthCare Bot written in Python and JavaScript. This conversational AI bot not only does help a customer in booking daily doctor appointments, searches for the nearest blood banks in emergency, but also provides the user a self-assessment to the recent Covid-19 based on user symptoms- all in a conversational pattern.

# Quickstart
To run the chatbot on your system, you can perform either of the following options:
<br>
- Clone the repository with ```git clone https://github.com/bishab/Capstone_KRGC0137.git```
- Download the zipped file directly from this repository.

<b> To proceed with setting environments for the chatbot, please make sure you've installed the following dependencies: </b>
- python3 (preferrably the latest one)
- rasa (version 3.x)
<br>
<i> Install rasa with ```pip install rasa==3.x``` </i>
<br>

Now you are good to initiate the chatbot in your command line interface. Please follow the following instructions to talk to the bot.
- This bot runs with RASA NLU and an additional RASA Action Server. Therefore, you will need to initiate the server on your new tab of the command line interface. Run ```rasa run actions``` on a new terminal (or a command line interface).
- Run ```rasa shell``` on a new terminal (or a command line interface).
- This will provide you the interactive shell based chatbot. You are good to go with the conversation.
